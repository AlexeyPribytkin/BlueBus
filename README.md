# BlueBus
This project aims to create a Bluetooth interface for vehicles equipped with
the BMW IBus. It supports A2DP, AVRCP and the HPF protocols. AVRCP Metadata
will be displayed on all supported devices along with full integration with the
vehicle to control playback. Additional functionality will be added to allow users
access to their vehicles service data and module information.
